- It is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviour of parent object.
- It is a IS-A relationship.
- keyword used for this is "extends"

**WHY ?**

- For code reusability (Moreover, can add new methods and fields in current class also)

**SYNTAX ?**
- class Sub-Class **extends** Parent-Class { }

**Types of Inheritance**
- Single 
- Multi-level
