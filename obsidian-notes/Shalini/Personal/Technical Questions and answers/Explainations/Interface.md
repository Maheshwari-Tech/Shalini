**WHAT and WHY?**
- Blue print of a class.
- **Static, constant and abstract methods** allowed.
- It only has the empty methods and not the implementation.
- **IS-A** relationship.
- It **cannot be instantiated.**
- Used to achieve **loose coupling**
- All the fields are **public, static and final by default**.
- A class that implements interface **must implement all the methods declare in the interface**.
- use **implements** keyword to implement the interface.
- In case the class does not provide an implementation for all the methods of the interface then the class must be declared abstract.
- They provide total abstraction.
- They help to achieve what we call multiple inheritances as java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances, but you can implement several interfaces in one class and thus it helps to achieve multiple inheritance.

**Syntax:**
public interface TelevisionRemote {  
	public void turnOnTelevision();
		public void turnOffTelevision();
	}
}

public class Television implements TelevisionRemote {   
	_@Override_   
	public void turnOnTelevision() {   
		//method implementation details   
	}   
	_@Override_   
	public  void turnOffTelevision() {   
		//method implementation details   
	}
}
