**WHAT ?**
- Abstraction is about focusing on what an object does and not how it does it
- Hiding **the** implementation details and only showing functionality to the user.

**HOW :**
There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java: â€“

1. By using interfaces
2. By using abstract classes

**ABSTRACT CLASS :** 
**![[Abstract Class]]**

**INTERFACE : 
![[Interface]]


**Difference between these TWO**


| Abstract class                                            | Interface                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Can have abstract and non abstract method                 | Can only have abstract, static and default method  |
| Doesn't support multiple inheritance as it is class.      | Supports multiple inheritance.                     |
| Can have final/non final, static/non static variable      | can have final and static variable                 |
| Can provide implementation of the interface               | Can't provide implementation of the abstract class |
| can have class member like private, public and protected. | public by default                                  |
