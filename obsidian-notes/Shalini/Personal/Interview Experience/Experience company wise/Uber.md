Round 1: OA
- 4 questions
- Topics - DP, String, Sorting, Array.
- Verdict - CLEARED.

Round 2: Screening Round:
- 1 question and a followup question.
	- Given input (x, y, 10) (y, b, 20) (b, c, 20)(c, x, 5). Need to tell what will be the cost of (c, y, 10);
	- x, y, a, b, c are countries and numbers are multiplier. 1 x = 10 Y. This is the currency exchange rate. We need to tell how much will be the ocst to convert 10 c to y? (GRAPH -> BFS)
	- Working code of this.
- Follow up -
	- If there are multiple paths then how do we calculate the minimum value path. (Just the approach)
	- Dijkistra's algo approach.
- Verdict - POSITIVE.

Round 3: DSA
- String (given a string s = "abcdcabd" and list of string {"a", "abc", "abcg", "acda"} and we need to tell how many substring and subsequences are present.) 

- Verdict - POSITIVE

Round 4: LLD
- Task scheduler library(similar to course scheduler but proper LLD with concurrency handling.)
- Verdict - NEGATIVE

Round 5: HLD
- Design Swiggy. 
- Verdict - POSITIVE
