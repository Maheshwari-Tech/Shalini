The **wrapper class in Java** provides the mechanism _to convert primitive into object and object into primitive_.

Since J2SE 5.0, **autoboxing** and **unboxing** feature convert primitives into objects and objects into primitives automatically. The automatic conversion of primitive into an object is known as autoboxing and vice-versa unboxing.

## Use of Wrapper classes in Java

Java is an object-oriented programming language, so we need to deal with objects many times like in Collections, Serialization, Synchronization, etc. Let us see the different scenarios, where we need to use the wrapper classes.
